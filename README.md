# NTEIM_Linux_GUI🐧

Having a Windows device, I thought it would be convenient to build a Linux GUI instead of actually downloading one. And, here it is😄! 
Though it's command are file & directory related, I plan on improving in NTEIM 2.0.0 
Do bear w/ me if they're an errors, as this is my first time building such a project. If you have any suggestions, do say in the discussion I created.
Thank you, and happy scripting!😄😄😄😄
